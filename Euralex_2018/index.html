### Introduction (1)

We discuss some facts of lexical synonymy in the modern Tatar language that have been encountered in the process of compiling the bilingual *Russian-Tatar Socio-Political Thesaurus*.

 The Tatar language of the recent decades:
 
 - has experienced a stage of renewal;
 
 - significant changes in vocabulary, including the emergence of a large number of synonymous items. 
 
 In present work, the main attention is paid to **absolute synonymy**.
---
### Introduction (2)
The conventional viewpoint is that true synonyms are rarely found in a language. 

Tatar socio-political vocabulary in many respects contradicts the thesis about rareness of absolute synonymy.

This phenomenon is observed due to a set of extralinguistic and intralinguistic causes, which needs explanations.
---

### Social Motivation of Changes in Tatar Vocabulary (1)

The Republic of Tatarstan is a multiethnic and multicultural region of Russia. 

Tatar is the language of the ethnic majority in the Republic; Tatars make up 53.2% of the Republic’s  population (Census 2010). 

Tatar co-exists with Russian as a state language under the current legislation that proclaims them as equal, according to the *Law on Languages* which was adopted in 1992.


---
### Social Motivation of Changes in Tatar Vocabulary (2)

By the late 1980s, the minority languages of the USSR had been largely supplanted by Russian.

The danger of losing the national language was  the main driving force of the ethnic renaissance in Tatarstan in the late 1980s.

The adoption of the **Language Law **(1992).

The implementation of the government-sponsored **Tatar language revival program**.

Active translation work was launched in state  institutions and an urgent need in Tatar socio-political terminology arose. 
---
### Current language situation in Tatarstan:

Tatar considerably concedes to Russian in

- functionality,

- domains of language use,

- social status and prestige,

- the degree of proficiency of people who use it.
---
### Social Motivation of Changes in Tatar Vocabulary (3)

Currently most Tatar socio-political terms are coined by calquing the Russian terms. 

Diverse groups of specialists with **dissimilar world-views** and **ideological guidelines**

Orientations towards different cultural spaces with different languages spoken:

- Tatar and Turkic vocabulary;
- Arabic and Persian vocabulary;
- international Greek, Latin or English vocabulary;
- Russian vocabulary, etc.

Heterogeneous preferences lead to proposing and choosing different designations for the same entity.

---
###*Tatar-Russian Socio-Political Thesaurus*: Main Goals and Methodology of Compiling (1)
The Thesaurus (http://tattez.antat.ru/) is aimed at compiling the whole body of modern Tatar vocabulary related to the following basic domains:
- state government, 

- economy, 

- social life, 

- justice, 

- warfare, 

- culture, 

- religion. 
---
###*Tatar-Russian Socio-Political Thesaurus*: Main Goals and Methodology of Compiling (2)

The Thesaurus is being developed on the basis of the Russian **RuThes** (http://www.labinform.ru/pub/ruthes/index_eng.htm) thesaurus. 

Both thesauri are implemented as a **hierarchy of concepts** viewed as units of thinking. 

Each concept is linked with a **set of language expressions** (single words and multiword expressions) that refer to it in texts (lexical entries).

---
###*Tatar-Russian Socio-Political Thesaurus*: Main Goals and Methodology of Compiling (3)

The Thesaurus is  compiled by manual translation of terms from the Russian RuThes into Tatar.

The Tatar language specific concepts and their lexical entries are added, so each part of the Thesaurus – the Russian and Tatar ones - represents a unique language-internal system of lexicalisations.
---

### Main sources: available Tatar corpora

Data from the following available Tatar corpora is used, each in open access: 

1) **The Corpus of Written Tatar**  (http://corpus.tatar/) compiled by researchers of Kazan Federal University;

2) **“Tugan Tel” Tatar National Corpus** (http://tugantel.tatar/) developed at the Institute of Applied Semiotics of the Tatarstan Academy of Sciences.

These corpora include texts of various genres, from official documents and scientific publications to media texts, fiction, and textbooks. 

The corpora have comparable volumes, each containing more than 100 millions tokens, and are supplied with a system of morphological annotation.

###Synonymy as a lexical phenomenon (1)

Linguists regard lexical synonymy as a mark of  high development of a language, enabling us to encode the most subtle differences between entities or ideas and different perspectives of viewing them.

The linguistic interpretation of synonymy is caused by a comprehension of lexical meaning, its nature and structure and is implemented within a certain theoretical framework. 


---
###Synonymy as a lexical phenomenon (2)

A prevailing point of view on absolute synonyms:

- absolute (total) synonymy **occurs infrequently** because 
 
>*yet even if near-synonyms do name one and the same thing, they name it in different ways: they present different perspectives on a situation* (Divijak 2010). 
---
###Synonymy as a lexical phenomenon (3)

Cruse maintains that two lexical units would be **absolute synonyms** *if and only if all their contextual relations were identical* (Cruse 1986). 

According to Lyons (1995) two (or more) synonymous expressions are **absolute synonyms** if  they satisfy the three following conditions: 

>1) all their meanings are identical;

>2) they are synonymous in all contexts;

>3) they are semantically equivalent (i.e. their meaning or meanings are identical) in all the dimensions of meaning, both the descriptive and the non-descriptive one (Lyons 1995).

### One word synonyms in Tatar SP Vocabulary

In Soviet era:

- many words were borrowed from Russian and European languages,
- were coined by component-by-component translation of Russian items. 

By the present time: 

A movement for the Tatar language revival led to an **active language renewal**, which caused enriching Tatar vocabulary with a great number of synonymous items of **Tatar** and **Oriental** (Arabic and Persian) origin. 

Many Arabic and Persian words (their derivatives) considered as obsolescent in the Soviet period (and correspondingly marked in dictionaries of the time) were entered into the active vocabulary fund. 

In modern Tatar, **words of different roots** (Turkic, Russian, Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and English) denoting the same referent, **are competing**.

###  Synonymy in Tatar SP Vocabulary

**Abundance of absolute synonyms** is a peculiarity of the Tatar language of the current stage.

 We observe instability and imbalance in Tatar terminology, when  diverse synonymous terms and terminological variants of different origin and structure are in actual use.

Parallel denominations can be used in a wide range of cases, including official names of state structures and social institutions.

Causes:

- coexistence of different centres of building Tatar terms; 

- lack of coordination between them.

---
### Fixing synonyms in SP Thesaurus

So in thesaurus compilation a separate task is to build the most complete list of synonymous denominations related to the same concept to fix them as lexical entries for the thesaurus.

The lists of synonyms in available dictionaries are incomplete (in many cases only one translation variant of a term is represented). 
---
### Conclusion (1)

Emergence of a great number of exact synonyms in Tatar is caused by a combination of **intralinguistic** and **extralinguistic conditions**. 

The location of Tatar culture at the intersection of **Occidental** and **Oriental** civilisations leads to active lexical borrowing both from Arab-Muslim and European cultural area. 

Borrowing vocabulary from European languages is carried out through **mediation of the Russian language**, and, a huge number of words and constructions are taken from Russian.

 Besides, a significant part of synonyms are built from **Turkic** and **Tatar** lexical material. 
 
 Therefore, words of different origin (Turkic and Tatar, Arabic and Persian, Greek, Latin, English and Russian), coexisting in Tatar, are related to the same referent, which causes a great number of synonyms at the single word level.
---
### Conclusion (2)
On one-word level - competition of **words/word stems of different origins**.

On multi-word level - competition of words/word stems of different origins is complicated by using **different grammatical structures**, the most characteristic of them is the parallelism of the *ADJ + N* and *N + N, POSS_3* constructions. 

So  semantic doubles abound in one-word items level as well as multi-word items level and they form synsets (doubles, triplets, multiplets) composed of items of different origin and structure.

Parallel denominations can be used for a wide range of phenomena, including some official names of departments and state structures.

---

### Conclusion (3)

Presently Tatar socio-political vocabulary is strongly influenced by Russian.

Main causes of emerging semantic doubles are

- languages contacts (on-going stream of loan-words and semantic calquing);

- richness of Tatar vocabulary and  potential grammatical models;

- dissimilar decisions made by terminology developers/translators.

---
### Conclusion (4)

We can conclude that a certain Tatar **terminology management** is required. 

It may be **descriptive** (describing how terms are used in documents and media texts) and **prescriptive** (or even *normative*) to document compilers (prescribing what terms must be used in standard work and official documentation and how they must be used).
