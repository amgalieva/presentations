## Introduction

General goals:
 * exploring the semantic properties of  Tatar   ambiguous affixes on corpus data;
 * development of methodology for automatic semantic classification of Tatar  ambiguous affixes.
 ---

Stages:

(a) extracting corpus contexts containing units with  ambiguous affixes; 

(b) manual semantic classification of these units;

(c) automatic classification of these units;

(d) automatic clusterization of contexts containing  ambiguous affixes.

---

###This presentation provides the first step into the classification of Tatar word forms containing -lık affix  within corpus data. 



---
###Typological features of the Tatar language:

###General information

The Tatar language belongs to the Turkic group  of the Altaic languages.

Tatar  is spoken in west-central Russia (in Volga region) and southern parts of Siberia. 

The number of Tatar speakers in Russia in 2010 was 4.28 million people.

The most important phonetic feature of the Turkic languages is progressive vowel harmony.


---

###Typological features of the Tatar language:

###Tatar agglutinative morphology 1

The basic way of word formation and inflection is progressive affixal: 

a new unit is built by consecutive addition of regular  derivational and inflectional affixes to the stem.

There is one type of declension and conjugation (one set of affixes is used only).

The order of affixes is rigidly determined.

---

###Tatar agglutinative morphology 2

Tatar Morphology is regular and predictable in many respects. 

There is no clear-cut borders between inflection and word formation.

The paradigm as a set of ready-made word forms is absent.

---
###An example of Tatar word form:

(1) .red[ *kitaplarınanmı?*]

kitap-||lar-||ı-  ||nan-||mı
:----:||:--:||:--:||:---:||:--
book- ||PL, ||POSS_3,||ABL,|| INT      

'whether from his books', 'from his books?'

---
###The Tatar language has affixes of different types:

a)  derivational affixes, expressing  only lexical meaning and forming new words:

.red[*Klasstaş*]

Klass- ||taş
:----:||:---
Class- ||co-

'Classmate'

---
###The Tatar language has affixes of different types:

b) inflectional affixes changing the word form (for example, case morphemes):

.red[*yortta*]

yort- ||ta
:----:||:---
house- ||LOC

'in house'

---
###The Tatar language has affixes of different types:
c) affixes serving as means of derivation (1) as well as inflection (2):

(1) .red[*başsız*]

baş-||sız
:----:||:---
head- ||ABESS

'silly, stupid'

(2) .red[ *başsız*]

baş-||sız
:----:||:---
head- ||ABESS

'headless'







The last type is called polyfunctional morphemes [Tatar grammar, 1993].

##'Tugan Tel' Tatar National Corpus

(http:// corpus.antat.ru)

- is designed by a team of computational linguists  from Research Institute of Applied Semiotics of Tatar Academy of Sciences (www.ips.antat.ru);

- is grammatically  annotated;

- now consists of written (mainly prosaic) texts;

- the estimated size is 82 million words;

- has a user-friendly interface and is accessed via Internet by any web browser.

---

##Grammatical annotation in TatNC

Two main fields for the morphological information about a Tatar word-form:

- part of speech characteristics of the stem;

- set of morphological characteristics for each part of speech tag.

The two-level morphological analyzer based on PC-KIMMO software is used. 

The system of grammatical annotation is based on Leipzig Glossing Rules (a number of tags, specific for the Tatar language, is added).

##Related works

The majority of works devoted to Turkic and Tatar ambiguous affixes is devoted to theoretical issues [Tungatarov 1973, Gasanov 1980, Ganiev 2005, Salakhova 2007, Tatar Grammar 2002]. 

 The ambiguity of  affixes is a matter of great difficulty and it is a challenge for Turkic language processing [Oflazer, K., & Kuruöz, I., 1994, Hakkani-Tür, Oflazer, & Tür. 2002, Daybelge &. Çiçekli.2007,   Oflazer 2014]. 

There is no special studies of  derivatives/word forms, containing Tatar  ambiguous affixes, implemented on corpus data, representing  real distribution of words and word forms.


---
### Why we have chosen -lık affix?

-Lık affix is  a productive  affix of high frequency  in modern Tatar.

**It builds**
 
- nominal,  
- adjectival,
- verbal;
- other derivatives / word forms. 

**It has  four allomorphs**

-lık /-lek, 

-lıg​, /-leg.

---
### Available classifications

The answer to the question of the number of the types of derivatives and word forms produced with – lık morpheme  is not trival, and different researchers distinguish different  types of derivatives.

F. Ganiev [2005] considers 7 basic derivational and 2 grammatical meanings of the  -lık affix.

R. Salakhova [2007] considers 6  types of nominal derivatives, one type of adjectival and one type of verbal derivatives.

In [Ganiev 2005] and [Salakhova 2007] the semantic classes of derivatives are very fractional and the criteria for referring derivatives to a certain class are rather vague.

---
## Our experiments:
###classification of -lık derivatives

**The object of classification**: word forms and derivatives containing -lık affix; 

**Linguistic data** is taken  from  Tatar National Corpus. 

**Total in Corpus**: 207,000 words forms and derivatives with -lık affix.

**Were extracted from Corpus**: 28,667 contexts (full sentences).


As far as the Corpus is not disambiguated, in its contexts -lık affix may be marked by means of two different tags:

- NMLZ (nominalizer) 
 
- PSBL (possibilitive form). 

---

###А. Manual (expert) classification

- 500 contexts were taken;

- 4 classes are distinguished.

---
##Description of classes

###Class 1: -lık affix 

- is attached to noun, adjective, numeral  and other stems; 

- functions as a derivational affix; 

- forms  new words - nouns of broad meaning (concrete nouns, abstract nouns and collective nouns).

(1) .red[*ak*] 'white' +lık > .red[ *aklık*] 'whiteness'

(2) .red[*narat*] 'pine-tree' +lık >.red[*naratlık*] 'pinery'

(3) .red[*taş*] 'stone, rock' +lık > .red[*taşlık*] 'stony ground'

(4) .red[*un*] 'ten'  +lık >  .red[*unlık*] 'ten-rouble note'

---

###Class 2: -lık affix

- is attached to noun stems; 

- links words  within a sentence;

- forms attributive words denoting  a  measure of something (including time measure).

A typical meaning is'enough for sth.':

(1) *ber .red[atna-lık] azık*

One     week-NMLZ food

'food for a week';

(2)  *ber .red[külmäk-lek] tukıma*

one    dress-NMLZ  fabric

'a piece of fabric suffice for a dress'

---

###Class 3: -lık affix

- is attached to verbal stems; 

- functions as a derivational affix; 

- forms attributive words

A typical meaning is  potentiality,  possibility, ability (inability in the negative form) to accomplish an action.

(1) .red[*tab-ar-lık] azık*

find-FUT_IND, PSBL food

'food that one may find'

(2) .red[*bir-er-lek] äyber*

give-FUT_IND, PSBL thing

'a thing that one may give (to somebody)'

---

###Class 4. A -lık affix

- is attached to verbal stems;

- serves as a means for attaching  a subordinate  clause to the main clause;

- makes  sentential arguments.

(1) *.red[Kar yaw-gan-lık-tan] cir ak.*

Snow fall- PCP_PS, NMLZ, ABL  ground white

The ground is white because snow has fallen.

(2) *Keşelär  .red[minem kemgä kayt-kan-lıg-ım turında] bähäsläşä.*

Man-PL my who-DIR return-PCP_PS, NMLZ, POSS_1 about  dispute_PRES

People dispute to whom I have come.


---
###B. Automatic classification of  lık forms.

We identified some empirical features of -lık constructs and performed an automatic classification of them. 


We have built relevant rules for semantic classification, and distinguished 4 classes of derivatives containing -lık affix. 
---
### Rules for automatic semantic classification are based on:

- **type of stem** (noun, adjective, verb, etc.);

- **affixal structure** of a word form containing -lık;

- **left context** of the word form containing -lık  (two elements to the left);

- **right  context** of the word form containing -lık (two elements to the right);

- **exception to the rules** for each class.
---
##Evaluation of results of automatic classification


##Distribution of contexts with -lık forms  

Class     || Precision
:--------:|:-------
1        ||89%
2        ||91%
3        ||97%
4        ||97%

---

###Table 1. Distribution of contexts with -lık forms  depending of types of stem.

Stem Type|| Number of -lık derivatives 
:--------:|:-------
N||121000
ADJ||112000
V  ||34000
NUM  ||4000


---
###Table 2. Distribution of semantic  classes of -lık derivatives


Class 1|| Class 2 || Class 3 ||Class 4
:----:||:----------:||:--------------:||:---
20 881|| 1846 || 4650|| 1290 

 ---
Total - 28 667 contexts
---

 
## Conclusions and Future Work

We built rules for automatic  semantic classification of  derivatives and word forms containing ambiguous   -lık affix, accomplished  automatic  classification of corpus contexts, and evaluated the results. 

The results of our study improve the results of preceding theoretical studies and may be used for corpus disambiguation:

 * tag MNLZ is to be attributed to classes 1, 2, 4;

 * tag PSBL is to be attributed to class 3.

A gained experience may be used for analysis of other Tatar and Turkic ambiguous affixes.
