## Introduction (1)

This paper discusses some of the issues and challenges encountered during the compilation of the Tatar-Russian Socio-Political Dictionary of collocations (TRDC).

Compiling the TRDC (http://spdict.antat.ru/) is carried out due to a combination of factors:
 * socio-political vocabulary is a significant formation of any language in active use, and it is undergoing permanent changes;
 * available bilingual Russian-Tatar dictionaries contain outdated data and are lacking new words and phrases, besides they contain rather a limited number of collocations;
 * Tatar corpora provide reliable information about Tatar socio-political vocabulary and lexical co-occurrences in actual use, so they are to be used in compiling new generation dictionaries.

---

## Introduction (2)

Collocations are 

 - highly specific for a particular language;
 
 - conventionalized and may have contextual restrictions.
 
Competently composed collocation dictionaries are a valuable resource 

 - for translators;
 
 - language learners (for beginners as well as advanced students).

In (Stubbs, 2002) collocation is defined as <blockquote> a lexical relation between two or more words which have a tendency to co-occur within a few words of each other in running text</blockquote>

Paul Nation (2001) summarizes the discussions about the importance of collocations with the following arguments: 

<blockquote>(1) language knowledge is collocational knowledge; </blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) fluent and appropriate language use requires collocational knowledge; </blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) many words are used in a limited set of collocations and knowing these is a part of what is involved in knowing the words.</blockquote>

Available CDs of **English**
* Benson, et al., 1986; Hill & Lewis, 1999; Mcintosh, et al., 2002; Rundell, 2010

 provide a wide repertoire of collocations and target different audiences. 

Similar CDs were launched for **other languages**: 

 * Spain (Bosque, 2004, 2006), 
 * French (Beauchesne, 2001),
 * Russian (Borisova, 1996), etc.

**Bilingual** CDs 
* Benson & Benson, 1993; Klégr, et al., 2005; Benson, et al., 1997; Konecny & Autelli, 2014; Orenha-Ottaiano, 2016; etc.

provide information about interlingual lexical correspondences and are aimed at encouraging learners and translators to more actively use collocations and incorporate them into their mental lexicon.

---
### Bilingual Tatar lexicography

Due to the historical destiny of the Tatar people  the main stream of bilingual Tatar lexicography was **Tatar-Russian** and **Russian-Tatar** 
 * Ganiyev, 1997; Agishev, 2001; Safiullina, 1996, 2002, etc.
 
In 90's  practical needs engendered the development of special lexicons, including bilingual Russian-Tatar socio-political dictionaries (Nizamov, 1995, Amirov, 1996, Ganiev, 1997).

By now 

 * these dictionaries contain the lexical data that is obsolete in many respects, 
 * the number of collocations in them is very limited.
---

### Available Tatar corpora

The TRDC is based on the data of the main available Tatar  corpora:

 * the Corpus of Written Tatar (http://search.corpus.tatar/en);
 
 * and the Tatar National Corpus (http://tugantel.tatar/). 
 
 These corpora include texts of various genres. The corpora have comparable volumes and are supplied with morphological description (information about the part of speech of the word stem and the set of its grammar features).
 
  Besides, the data from a special collection – Socio-Political Subcorpus of the Tatar language (http://tugantel.tatar/corpus/op/search/)

---

###Methodology of compiling the dictionary

The methodology of compiling TRDC included the following main stages:

 * selecting header words using corpus data;
 
 * retrieving collocations in Tatar corpora and linguistic dictionaries;
 
 * translating collocations into Russian.


---
###The structure of an entry

 * HEADER WORD  – Tatar word, frequently used in socio-political discourse;
 
 * Russian translation of the header word (only senses relevant for socio-political discourse are provided);
 
 * lexical compatibility to the right, Russian translation of collocations; 
 
 * lexical compatibility to the left, Russian translation of collocations.


---
###  Main structural types of collocations

Structural type of collocation :||:Example,  translation :||:Number in the Dictionary
:------------------------------:||:----------------------:||:-----
N + N, POSS_3            ||.navy[<i>банк хезмәткәре</i>] ‘bank employee’ ||779
ADJ + N                  ||.navy[<i>мәдәни тормыш</i>] ‘cultural life’   ||534
N + N, PL, POSS_3        ||.navy[<i>дин нигезләре</i>] ‘foundations of religion’||152
N + V, VN                ||.navy[<i>музей ачу</i>] ‘opening of the museum’ ||226
N, ATTR + N              ||.navy[<i>абруйлы шәхес</i>] ‘authoritative person’||73

### Lemmatization of collocations (1)

Compiling dictionaries for languages of rich morphology, like Tatar, sets the problem of lemmatization of linguistic items.

 Fix collocations in  basic form, preserving the basic grammatical structure of the components. 
 The total automatic lemmatization of linguistic data is of little avail, because it destructs grammatically conditioned word combinations.
 
  The basic form of a collocation (phrase) is determined by grammatical properties of its main component that can join dependent components of **certain types** and **only in grammatically admitted word forms**. 
  
  Example:
  
  .navy[<i>банк хезмәткәре</i>] ‘Bank employee’
  
  Bank + employee-POSS_3
  
  




---
### Lemmatization of collocations (2)

#### Representing grammatical voice forms

The Tatar language has 5 grammatical voices (the Basic, Passive, Reflexive, Reciprocal and Causative voices); voice affixes are added immediately to the verbs' stems and form extended stems.
 The precise meanings of voice derivates may be individual for each stem and ambiguous in many cases.
 
In TRDC we treat verb voice forms as individual items related to the same header word:

.navy[<i>Ярышлар үтү</i>]

competition-PL pass-VN

 ‘to be held – on competitions’ (the header word ЯРЫШ ‘competition’).
 
.navy[<i>Ярышлар үткәрү</i>]

competition-PL pass-CAUS, VN

 ‘to hold competitions’ (the header word ЯРЫШ ‘competition’).

---
### Lemmatization of collocations (3)

####  Fixing and translating predicative phrases (1)

In Tatar there are **predicative phrases** 

- consisting of a syntactic subject and a predicate

- with a non-finite verb form (verbal nouns). 

- express subject-predicate coordination

- does not express any grammatical tense or mood.

 Because of their absence in Russian, it is difficult to translate them  and their structure is hard to explain. 
 
 Potential decision - fixing finite verb forms (is not used):
 
.navy[<i>Ярышлар узды</i>.]

competition-PL pass-CAUS, PAST_DEF

 ‘Competitions have been held’.
 
---
### Lemmatization of collocations (3)

####  Fixing and translating predicative phrases (2)

Fixing the form of verbal nouns – hybrid forms lacking indices of the tense or person; nevertheless, they possess a grammatical voice marker. 

We offer a descriptive translation:

.navy[<i>Ярышлар узу</i>]

competition-PL pass-VN

'to be held’ – about competitions.

---
### Lemmatization of collocations (4)

#### Lemmatizing items containing polyfunctional affixes (1)

The Tatar language has affixes of different types:

a) derivational affixes, expressing only lexical meaning and forming new words;
b) inflectional affixes changing the word form (for example, case affixes);
c) affixes serving as means of derivation as well as inflection (polyfunctional affixes).

The last affixes are ambiguous.

---
### Lemmatization of collocations (4)

#### Lemmatizing items containing polyfunctional affixes (2)

An example - the abessive affix сыз/-сез – the affix expressing the lack / absence of sth:

.navy[<i>законсыз</i>]

law-ABESS

1) illegal, unlawful (derivation level):

.navy[<i>законсыз митинг</i>] ‘illegal rally’;

2) lawless (morphology level):

.navy[<i>андый законсыз булмый</i>] ‘it is impossible to live without such a law’.

Currently all such items, are included in the entries with noun header word in order to unify the way of fixing them in the dictionary; for example, the item **законсыз**, regardless of its sense, is included in the nest .navy[<i>ЗАКОН</i>] 'law'.

---
 ### Distinguishing synonyms and variants of collocations (1)

 Rather a technical solution:
 
1. Regular correspondences like ADJ + N and N + N, POSS_3 are  interpreted as the same nominative item and are given in the same line:

.navy[<i>икътисади кризис</i>] (ADJ + N),

.navy[<i>икътисад кризисы</i>] (N + N, POSS_3)

‘economic crisis’.
---
 ### Distinguishing synonyms and variants of collocations (2)

Synonymous items formed by synonyms of different roots are presented in different lines:

1..navy[<i>ислам мәдәнияте</i>] ‘Islamic culture’;

.navy[<i>мөселман мәдәнияте</i>] ‘Muslim culture’;

2..navy[<i>акционерлык җәмгыяте</i>] ‘joint-stock company’;

.navy[<i>акционерлык оешмасы</i>] ‘joint-stock company’;

.navy[<i>акционерлык ширкәте</i>] ‘joint-stock company’.

The TRDC represents numerous synonymous collocations which are used to designate topical realities of modern socio-political life. 
---

###5 Conclusion and future work

 The compiled TRDC makes it possible: 
 
 1) to fix the real use of Tatar words, including items which are actively used in a large number of Tatar official and media texts; nevertheless those are absent in available special and bilingual Russian-Tatar dictionaries; 
 
 2) to detect and fix typical grammatical models and contexts of using items denoting socio-political realities; 
 
 3) to trace words of new mintage in the Tatar language functioning in Russian geopolitical space; 
 
 4) to keep numerous synonymous nominations used in Tatar media texts and official documents; 5) to offer Russian translations of words and collocations.
 
Currently TRDC contains 250 header words and more than 4,000 collocations with their Russian translations and information about the grammatical structure of the collocations.
